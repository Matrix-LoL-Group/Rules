# 1. Eligibility Requirements
## 1.1 Account Vetting
Matrix League will analyze player's accounts and they will ask questions to be sure they are eligible to play in the league.

### 1.1.1 Account name eligibility
Player's account must be eligible according to the terms of Name Conformity. (refer to [1.2](#12-name-conformity))

# 2. Teams

## 2.1 Roster Requirements
Each team must have minimum 5 and maximum 10 players in their team. Other team members are not included in it (Coach, Team Manager etc.). Players can be swapped through-out the split until the play-offs start. Every team is allowed a maximum of 12 players through-out the split. Joining with 10 players consume 10 spots, meaning you have 2 swaps left.
A new player to a team must be announced at least 24 hours before the next game, unless you wish to lose bans (see Rule 2.2.6).
Teams have to register for the tournament using the [link to challenger mode - https://www.challengermode.com/s/MatrixGroup/tournaments?state=upcoming](https://www.challengermode.com/s/MatrixGroup/tournaments?state=upcoming), and you must also register through the Google Forms Document in the Discord Server. 

### 2.1.1 Players
Players are only allowed to be assigned to one team. Teams and players will adhere to the admins' decisions.

### 2.1.2 Team Captain
The Team Captain is responsible for its own teams' behavior. The Captain will always be in contact with the Matrix League staff to prevent problems between the team and the league.

### 2.1.3 Team Manager
The Team Manager is responsible for its own teams' behavior as well as The Captain. The Manager will be nominated as the Team Representative, and will participate in MXL Democratic Votings. The Team Manager will also be held responsible if the team is found to have "smurfs".

### 2.1.4 Team Coach
Coaches are not exclusively bound to one team, meaning they can coach multiple teams. When/If these teams play against each other, The Coach must stay neutral and can not participate. The Coach can stay with the team during champion selection to help with the Pick & Ban phase, leaving when the game starts. 

### 2.1.5 Disqualification
A team that is found to have broken enough rules the MXL Admins see fit, can be disqualified. All players from that team will be considered Free Agents unless stated as otherwise. All past and future games of this team will be forfeited.

### 2.1.6 Team Withdrawal
A team may withdraw themselves for any reason or at any time. All players from that team will be considered Free Agents unless stated as otherwise.

## 2.2 Roster Modification
Rosters changes are allowed as long they are explicitly approved by the admins via the Tickets and in ChallengerMode.

### 2.2.1 Substitutes
A Team may substitute a player between matches. These changes must be announced to the opponent team BEFORE the draft. These must be listed in the squad-report to be allowed to play. If they are not listed, they are counted as an emergency substitute (See Rule 2.2.3)

### 2.2.2 Fill players
A fill player is defined by a player that does not belong to the team the player is filling for. A fill player can belong to another team in this league, because the fill player is filling for one game/series. The fill must be listed in the squad-report, either as a starter or as a sub. The team using a fill player will lose 2 bans for each game the fill player is playing. The fill players' peak rank will be taken into consideration of the team's points to avoid it going over the max limit. It is the Team Manager and/or the Team Captain's responsibility to follow this.
Fills cannot be used for Best of 5's.

### 2.2.3 Emergency Substitutes
An emergency substitute is defined by a player that is brought to play for a team, in a short period of time before the game is to be played, without this player being listed in the squad-report. An emergency substitute can not be a current player in another team in Matrix League. For every game the emergency substitute is playing, the offending team will lose 3 bans.

### 2.2.4 Free Agency
A Free Agent is a member or a player that does not belong to a team. These can be registered as players in teams. A player that is no longer playing in Matrix League because their team got knocked out is not counted as a Free Agent.

### 2.2.5 Transfers
A) A transfer is when a player leaves one team to join another team in Matrix League. This is doable by noticing admins of this in a ticket. However, a transfer is not possible if the player transferring is going away from a team that is knocked out of the tournament. If this player was released and is counted as a free agent before the team is knocked out, the transfer can go through. This means that if a team gets knocked out, all current players in this team can not transfer to another team, in the current split. They can still play as a fill (See rule 2.2.2).

B) Assigning new players are not possible after the Group Stage / Regular Split is concluded. This meaning it is not possible to assign a new player when the Playoffs Week has started. For Split 1 2022, the deadline date is Sunday, February 6th.  

### 2.2.6 Roster Lock-In
A) 24 hours before the next game, the team captain or the team manager need to send the In-Game names of the 5 players that will play the series, including an op.gg multi search. If substitutes are to be used during the series these need to be listed below the 5 names as “substitutes”. The 5 players listed in the 24-h-squad-report must play game 1 in the series. Failure to send the squad report at least 24 hours before the next game will lead to the offending team losing 3 bans the first game. Failure to do it within 12 hours before the next game will lead to the offending team losing 3 bans for the whole series. Failure to send a squad report at all will lead to the offending team forfeiting the series.
Players are free to lane swap and role swap at any point before/during/after draft.

B) If one of the players is not available before the match, the team has 15 minutes to bring a substitute as a replacement. If a substitute that is listed in the squad report is brought, the offending team will lose 1 ban the first game. 

C) If the team is unable to gather a full team to play the match, the team will automatically forfeit the game.

D) If the two teams playing, schedule their next game to be less than 24 hours from the moment of the scheduling, the 24-hour rule will not be used towards the teams, as long as they communicate this with the MXL Staff. A squad-report is still needed, and the 12-hour rule still remains. 

### 2.3 Name - Tag – Logo
Requirements to be met in adherence to team name/tag/logo rules.

#### 2.3.1 Team Name & Tag
- Team name cannot be shorter than 3 or longer than 24, and team tag can have min. 2 or max. 4 characters.

Bantering about teams or players is allowed as long as it refers to gameplay within the league, and not attacks on the person itself.
